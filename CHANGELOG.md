# Changelog

## 0.5.3 - Unreleased

- Removed the incomplete bundled Traditional Chinese (`zh_TW`) starter locale
  pack from the source tree until it can be maintained as a complete
  translation set.
- Documented that bundled starter locales are repository-maintained runtime
  files, while WordPress.org directory translations remain managed separately
  through translate.wordpress.org/GlotPress.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-06-22

- Reworked the wp-admin surface around ordinary site operators: renamed the
  entry point to Site AI Abilities, added overview, available abilities, checks,
  and developer access tabs, and kept developer details available without making
  them the default experience.
- Added user-facing safe check summaries with purpose tables and collapsed raw
  JSON so site owners can understand what the checks prove without reading API
  payloads first.
- Refreshed the Chinese admin translation catalog for the updated settings page,
  check result summaries, plugin action links, and WordPress.org listing copy.
- Prepared WordPress.org listing content, FAQ, screenshots, banner/icon notes,
  and release assets for the operator-focused positioning.
- Added read-only review artifacts for image candidates, internal link
  candidates, taxonomy suggestions, and comment reply suggestions while keeping
  final writes host-governed.
- Published WordPress.org SVN revision 3581125 after `composer release:verify`
  completed with Plugin Check reporting no errors.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-06-07

- Added Composer dependency advisory audit to the default `composer test:all`
  source gate.
- Aligned GitHub Actions and PHPStan with the package PHP 8.0 runtime floor.
- Published the canonical public GitHub repository and documented the
  post-publication gate baseline.
- Upgraded GitHub Actions checkout to the Node 24-compatible
  `actions/checkout@v5`.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-06-06

- Improved the admin page as a connection and discovery surface with clearer package status, catalog navigation, copyable REST endpoints, and two bounded read-only checks.
- Added bundled translation templates and eight starter locale packs for the admin connection/discovery surface, API ability labels/descriptions, and common runtime error messages.
- Removed development demo ability controls from the admin page and kept showcase, model-call, write, and workflow execution outside this package surface.
- Renamed nonproduction cleanup abilities and media cleanup inputs to avoid public `test` terminology in released ability ids and schema fields.
- Updated `npcink-abilities-toolkit/adopt-cloud-media-derivative` and `npcink-abilities-toolkit/replace-media-file` to preview and commit exact post-content media URL repairs, including old intermediate-size image URLs, when an approved replacement switches an attachment to a new local file.
- Added `npcink-abilities-toolkit/propose-post-taxonomy-terms`, a deterministic taxonomy assignment proposal helper that targets `npcink-abilities-toolkit/set-post-terms` without mutating posts or creating terms.
- Added a 0.5 verification note that records the taxonomy terms Core consumer proof and keeps the package in freeze/observe mode until a concrete workflow gap appears.
- Added a Npcink AI main repo harvest checkpoint that maps content/media/comment/batch cleanup signals to existing abilities and confirms that no new ability batch should start from candidate lists alone.
- Expanded the Core consumer handoff check to assert the five harvested surfaces and their corresponding host-governed write targets expose Abilities API discovery metadata, schemas, dry-run controls, and approval metadata.
- Documented the foundation-layer testing strategy and clarified that `composer test:all` is the default local source gate for contract, governance, performance, and lightweight regression coverage.
