# 0.5.5 Release Verification

Status: release candidate fully verified; publication operations remain
pending.

This patch candidate keeps the 0.5.4 ability and workflow-definition contracts
unchanged. It isolates the packaged Plugin Check regression test from WP-CLI
runtime variables exported by a parent release process, so the test continues
to execute its intended fake `wp` command in both standalone and
cross-repository gates.

The release lane now accepts fail-closed M4 Docker evidence bound to the exact
Toolkit Git revision and distribution archive. This keeps the WordPress/PHP
compatibility matrix on the M4 host while the same `release:verify` command
still runs the source gate, PHPStan, LocalWP smoke, and packaged Plugin Check.

## Boundary

- No ability id, schema, annotation, callback, package profile, or workflow
  definition changed.
- Approval truth, audit truth, workflow runtime, cloud execution, and final
  write authorization remain outside Toolkit.
- The changes affect release test isolation and revision-bound compatibility
  evidence only; production ability, Plugin Check, and package-building
  behavior is unchanged.

## Verification Matrix

| Check | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inherited-environment package-check regression | Pass | `test:plugin-package-check` passed with parent `WP_CLI_PHP`, error-reporting, and socket variables set. |
| `composer test:all` | Pass | All source, contract, package, lifecycle, performance, and syntax checks passed. |
| `composer analyse:phpstan` | Pass | PHPStan reported no errors on the final candidate source. |
| `composer check:boundary` | Pass | Project boundary guard passed. |
| Revision-bound evidence guard | Pass | Exact-HEAD and distribution-archive binding, both required profiles, M4 runner identity, Docker version, and freshness are validated fail closed; stale and incomplete fixtures are rejected. |
| `composer release:verify` with M4 evidence | Pass | One release command accepted exact-revision M4 evidence and passed the source gate, PHPStan, diff check, LocalWP smoke, and packaged Plugin Check. |
| Local WordPress smoke | Pass | Default and light profiles passed with 443 and 58 assertions. |
| Packaged Plugin Check | Pass with warnings | No errors; existing translation-loading and bounded database-query warnings remain. |
| M4 minimum WordPress/PHP smoke | Pass | WordPress 6.9.4 with PHP 8.0 passed 441 assertions. |
| M4 current WordPress/PHP smoke | Pass | WordPress 7.0 with PHP 8.5 passed 441 assertions. |
| Cross-repository release acceptance | Pass | Core, Adapter, Toolkit, package installation, signed approved execution, LocalWP smoke, and the exact-revision M4 evidence lane passed in one acceptance run. |
| Cross-repository quality matrix | Pass | All six repository gates passed. Toolbox also reported three preserved uncommitted browser-smoke test files that require separate ownership before publication. |
| Release ZIP | Pass | Two reproducible builds of `npcink-abilities-toolkit-0.5.5.zip` contain 88 files and share SHA-256 `1406a19a61af6ce28d8109ff0e042bc4623a65e4589f9892195dda15d5174f8e`. |

## Publication Gate

The code and compatibility gates are complete. Before creating `0.5.5` or
publishing the package, resolve ownership of the preserved Toolbox test edits,
publish the topic branches through protected pull requests, and verify the
merged release commits still match the reviewed candidates. Tag creation and
WordPress.org publication remain explicit release-owner operations.
